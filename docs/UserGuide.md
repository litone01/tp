## Introduction
SOChedule is a one-stop solution for NUS School of Computing (SoC) students to manage their tasks and events effectively.
Targeted at users who can type fast and prefer typing to mouse input, SOChedule is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) 
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `SOChedule.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your SOChedule.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. A sample SOChedule is given below. There would not be pre-entered data on first launch so that users start using immediately.
    <br><br>
    ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list_task`** : Lists all tasks.

   * **`add_task`**`n/CS2103 assignment d/2022-04-07 p/1 c/schoolwork t/urgent` : Adds a task named `CS2103 assignment` to the SOChedule with its respective attributes. Please verify the validity of the date parameter.

   * **`delete_task`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd task shown in the current list.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `undone_task INDEX`, `INDEX` is a parameter which can be used as `undone_task 1`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/TASKNAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Quiz t/CS2103` or as `n/Quiz`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/1 p/2`, only `p/2` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list_task`, `list_event`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `list_task 123`, it will be interpreted as `list_task`.

### Exiting the program: `exit`
Exits the program.

[Return to Feature List](#feature-list)

### Adding a task: `add_task`
Adds a task into the task list.

Format: `add_task n/TASKNAME d/DEADLINE p/PRIORITY [c/CATEGORY]... [t/TAG]...`
* `n/` is followed by the task name, it is case-sensitive.
* `d/` is followed by the date of deadline, with the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. <br>
  Deadline cannot be a past date.
* `p/` is followed by the priority, with 0 being highest and 9 being lowest. <br>
  Other inputs are not accepted.
* `c/` is followed by the category. Different categories are separated by white space (e.g. `c/c1 c/c2`). <br>
  It is optional.
* `t/` is followed by the tag. Different tags are separated by white space (e.g. `t/t1 t/t2`). <br>
  It is optional.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:** <br>

* Any valid prefixes and input arguments (e.g. <code>n/Homework 1</code> or <code>p/1</code>) followed by invalid prefixes and input arguments (e.g. <code>name/Name</code>, <code>tag/Tag</code> or <code>T&sk</code>) will lead to an error.
* If the same prefix (excluding <code>c/</code>, <code>t/</code>) appears multiple times in the input (e.g. <code>n/n1 n/n2 n/n3</code>), only the last occurrence would be taken (i.e. <code>n/n3</code>).

</div>

Examples:
* `add_task n/CS2103 assignment d/2022-02-27 p/1 c/schoolwork t/urgent` adds a new task named "CS2103 assignment" with the respective parameters.
* `add_task n/CCA admin work d/2022-02-28 p/2 c/CCA` adds a new task "CCA admin work" with the respective parameters.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Deleting a task: `delete_task`
Deletes a task from the task list.

Format: `delete_task INDEX`
* Deletes the task at the specified INDEX.
* The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the currently **displayed** task list.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Examples:
* `list_task` followed by `delete_task 2` deletes the second task in the full task list.
* `find_task homework` followed by `delete_task 1` deletes the first task in the result of the `find_task` command.

[Return to Feature List](#feature-list)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Editing a task: `edit_task`
Edits an **existing and uncompleted** task in the task list.

Format: `edit_task INDEX [n/TASKNAME] [d/DEADLINE] [p/PRIORITY] [c/CATEGORY]... [t/TAG]...`
* Edits the task at the specified `INDEX`. 
* Only an **existing and uncompleted** task can be edited. <br>
  (i.e. Completed tasks cannot be edited)
* **At least one** of the optional fields must be provided.
* `DEADLINE` provided cannot be a past date.
* When editing tags/categories, the existing tags/categories of the task will be removed. <br>
  (i.e. adding of tags/categories is not cumulative)
* Edited task cannot be the same as the original task or equivalent to another existing task in the task list. <br>
  Same tasks means the name, priority, deadline, tags (if any) and categories (if any) of two tasks are equal.
* When editing tags and categories, the order given in the input and the order as shown in the UI can be different. <br>
  For example, in input `edit_task 1 t/t2 t/t10`, `t/t2` is before `t/t10` in the input, but `t10` may appear in the UI before `t2`.
  Lexicographical order is followed.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:** <br>

* Any valid prefixes and input arguments (e.g. <code>n/Homework 1</code> or <code>p/1</code>) followed by invalid prefixes and input arguments (e.g. <code>name/Name</code>, <code>tag/Tag</code> or <code>T&sk</code>) will lead to an error.

* You can remove all the task’s tags by typing <code>t/</code> without specifying any tags after it.<br>
  Similarly, you can remove all the task’s categories by typing <code>c/</code> without specifying any categories after it
  
* If the same prefix (excluding <code>c/</code>, <code>t/</code>) appears multiple times in the input (e.g. <code>n/n1</code> <code>n/n2</code>), the latter one would be taken (i.e. <code>n/n2</code>).

</div>

Examples:
* `edit_task 1 n/t1` edits the name of the first task (if present in SOChedule) to be `editedTaskName`.
* `edit_task 2 p/3 t/` edits the priority of the second task (if present in SOChedule) to be `3` and clears all existing tags.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Marking one or more tasks as done: `done_task`
Marks one or more task from the task list as completed.

Format: `done_task INDEX1 [INDEX2] ...`
* Marks the task(s) at the specified INDEX(es) as completed.
* Specified task(s) must not be completed.
* Multiple indices are to be separated by a whitespace, e.g. `1 2`.
* All specified tasks must be **uncompleted and existing** before calling this command.
* **Duplicate indices** are not allowed. <br>
  Otherwise, an error message indicating invalid command format will be returned.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:** <br>

* If indices provided include both an index for a task not existing in task list and an index for a completed task,
  the error message will only be about the non-existing task.

</div>

Examples:
* `done_task 1 2` marks the first and second task in the task list as completed.

### Finding tasks by name: `find_task`
Finds tasks whose names contain any of the given keywords from the task list.

Format: `find_task KEYWORD1 [KEYWORD2] ...`
* The search is **case-insensitive**, e.g. `homework` will match `Homework`.
* The search scope is the **full** task list.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. <br>
  E.g. `Practice Problems` will match `Problems Practice`.
* Only the name of the tasks is searched.
* Only full words will be matched. E.g. `CS` will not match `CS2103`.
* Tasks matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). <br>
  E.g. `CS2103 Homework` will return `ST2131 Homework`, `CS2103 Quiz`.

Examples:
* `find_task Homework` returns `st2131 homework` and `Homework 1`
* `find_task assignment homework` returns `Assignment 1`, `Homework 2`

### Sorting all tasks: `sort_task`
Sorts the task list.

Format: `sort_task ARGUMENT`
* Sorts task list and updates UI based on supplied argument.
* Accepted arguments (case-sensitive):
   * `name`: Sorts by task name, in increasing lexicographical order
   * `deadline`: Sorts by task deadline, in increasing date order
   * `completion`: Sorts by task completion status, with completed tasks at the bottom
   * `priority`: Sorts by task priority, in decreasing order, from priority 0 on top, to priority 9 at the bottom
* On subsequent boots, the following will happen:
   * Relative order from previous launch will be preserved.
   * However, if any order-altering command (`pin_task`, `unpin_task`, and `find_task`) is issued, tasks will be sorted by name by default, unless otherwise stated by another `sort_task` command.
   * Marking a task as complete (`done_task`) or incomplete (`undone_task`) or adding (`add_task`) and editing (`edit_task`) tasks does not constitute an order-altering command.
    
Examples:
* `sort_task completion` sorts the task list by completion status.
* `sort_task name` sorts the task list by name.

### Pinning a task: `pin_task`
Pins a task from the task list.

Format: `pin_task INDEX`
* Pins the task at the specified INDEX.
* Already pinned tasks will be unable to be pinned a second time.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list.
* After pinning, the Task List will be sorted either according to previously entered `sort_task` command, or name (by default). See [here](#illustration-of-the-interaction-between-pin_task-and-sort_task).
    * Should there be two or more pinned tasks, the pinned tasks will be sorted as well.
    * Only the fact that pinned tasks will appear over the unpinned tasks is guaranteed. <br>
      Internal order of pinned tasks is not persistent over `sort_task`.
* Pinned tasks are persistent over instances of SOChedule.

Examples:
* `pin_task 1` pins the first task in the task list

  It is optional.
  
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:** <br>

* The `STARTDATE` and `STARTTIME` provided can be in the past for ongoing events.
  
* Events that overlap in date and time are allowed.
  
* Any valid prefixes and input arguments (e.g. <code>n/Meeting 1</code> or <code>st/14:00</code>) followed by invalid prefixes and input arguments (e.g. <code>name/Name</code>, <code>tag/Tag</code> or <code>E@ent</code>) will lead to an error.

* If the same prefix (excluding <code>c/</code>, <code>t/</code>) appears multiple times in the input (e.g. <code>n/n1 n/n2 n/n3</code>), only the last occurrence would be taken (i.e. <code>n/n3</code>).

</div>

Format: `edit_event INDEX [n/EVENTNAME] [sd/STARTDATE] [st/STARTTIME] [ed/ENDDATE] [et/ENDTIME] [c/CATEGORY]... [t/TAG]...`
* Edits the event at the specified `INDEX`.
* An expired event could only be edited when users edit the past end date and time to an unexpired end date and time. <br>
  (i.e. top extend the event).

* **At least one** of the optional fields must be provided.
* The `ENDDATE` and `ENDTIME` provided must be **after** `STARTDATE` and `STARTTIME`.
* The `ENDDATE` and `ENDTIME` provided cannot be a past date and time.
* When editing tags/categories, the existing tags/categories of the event will be removed. <br>
  (i.e. adding of tags/categories is not cumulative)
* When editing tags and categories, the order given in the input and the order as shown in the UI can be different. <br>
  For example, in input `edit_event 1 t/tag1 t/tag2`, `t/tag1` is before `t/tag2`, but `tag2` may appear in the UI before `tag1`.
  
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:** <br>

* The `STARTDATE` and `STARTTIME` provided can be in the past for ongoing events.

* Events that overlap in date and time are allowed.
  
* Any valid prefixes and input arguments (e.g. <code>n/Meeting</code> or <code>st/00:00</code>) followed by invalid prefixes and input arguments (e.g. <code>name/Name</code>, <code>tag/Tag</code> or <code>E@ent</code>) will lead to an error.

* You can remove all the event’s tags by typing <code>t/</code> without specifying any tags after it.<br>
  Similarly, you can remove all the event’s categories by typing <code>c/</code> without specifying any categories after it

* If the same prefix (excluding <code>c/</code>, <code>t/</code>) appears multiple times in the input (e.g. <code>n/n1</code> <code>n/n2</code>), the latter one would be taken (i.e. <code>n/n2</code>).

</div>

Examples:
* `edit_event 1 n/editedEventName` edits the name of the first event (if present in the event list) to be 
  `editedEventName`.
* `edit_event 2 sd/2021-03-18 t/` edits the start date of the second event (if present in the event list) to be 
  `2021-03-18`and clears all existing tags.
